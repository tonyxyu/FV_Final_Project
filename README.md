## [Developer] Development Notice

### Service Design
At the beginning of the development of our services, we first carried out a careful design, in which we focus on the adoption of the following design patterns to decompose the modules, making it easier to extend and maintain the code in the future.

#### Command Pattern
Instead of directly calling the service methods from the Springboot routes, we use the command pattern to encapsulate the detailed service logic into command objects. This way, we satisfy the Single Responsibility Principle, the route handler only needs to focus on the request and response, and the command object is responsible for implementing the different service logic (Freeman 208).

#### Composite Pattern
We use the composite pattern to organize the Organization, Department, and Employee hierarchy. This way, we satisfy the Open-Closed Principle, we can traverse the organization structure uniformly, and easily add new types of entities (Freeman 364).

#### Singleton Pattern
In order to ensure that the database connection is only created once, and to improve its reliability under high concurrency, we use the singleton pattern to make sure database connection only has one instance and provide a global access point to it (Freeman 179).

#### Strategy Pattern
To decouple the database implementation details from our service logic, we designed the `HrDatabaseFacade` to use the Strategy Pattern. Instead of directly integrating specific database connections, the facade holds a reference to a generic `DatabaseConnection` interface. At runtime, we inject a concrete implementation, such as `MysqlConnection` or `InmemConnection`, into it. This design allows us to switch between different database strategies without altering the core service logic, making the system extensible and adhering to the Open-Closed Principle (Freeman 24).

#### Facade Pattern
Given the inherent complexity that comes with databases, to ensure the Law of Demeter, we use the facade pattern to encapsulate the database operations. This way, the service logic does not need to know the details of the database operations, and the database operations can be easily replaced in the test and in the future (Freeman 272).

#### Chain of Responsibility Pattern
To streamline request processing and separate concerns across different stages, we utilize the Chain of Responsibility pattern in our middleware layer. This approach allows us to create a chain of middleware components, each with a unique responsibility, that sequentially handle incoming requests. For instance, our first middleware logs every incoming request and outgoing response, fulfilling logging and monitoring needs. The second middleware decodes the cid parameter, so our core service logic remains isolated from specific decoding algorithms. By following the Chain of Responsibility pattern, we ensure that each middleware component can independently address its task, and new functionality can be added or modified easily without affecting existing logic (Freeman 623).


### Running Cloud Service

To reach our service using cloud computing, please follow the steps below:
1. When running tests in Postman point them to: https://coms-4156-team-project.ue.r.appspot.com/
2. If the home/index page displays "Welcome, in order to make an API call direct your browser or Postman to an endpoint," then the service is operational and connection is successful.
3. Test the endpoints by passing the endpoint name and parameters via Postman or some other tools. For example: https://coms-4156-team-project.ue.r.appspot.com/getEmpInfo?cid=MQ&eid=2

### Running Test Suite
Our unit tests are located under directory `src/test`. After setting up and building the project, run
```bash
mvn test
```
You may also run the tests by right click any class in src/test directory and run to see the results if you are using IntelliJ IDEA as IDE.

### Style Checking Report
In order to make sure the code is following the style guide, we use Maven Checkstyle plugin. To run the checkstyle report, run the following command:
```bash
mvn checkstyle:check
```
One of the latest checkstyle report is located at `./checkstyle.out` file.
![CheckStyle Report](./checkstyle.png)

### Static Analysis

#### GitHub CodeQL Analysis CI
We use [GitHub CodeQL](https://codeql.github.com/) to perform static analysis on our code.
The CodeQL CI is run automatically on every PR to the main branch. The CodeQL analysis badge is displayed at the top of this README file.

#### PMD Static Analysis Report
We use PMD to perform static analysis on our code. To generate the static analysis report, you need to install the PMD tool as documented in I1. Then
run the following command:
```bash
pmd check -d src/main -R rulesets/java/quickstart.xml -f text
```
The static analysis report is located at `./pmdcheck.out` file. We have solved amost all the static bugs found by PMD, but there are still some static bugs remaining. According to the assignment requirements,
> If static bugs remain at the time of submission you must document these and explain why they remain.

We document the reasons for the remaining static bugs here:
1. **AvoidUsingVolatile**: [category/java/multithreading/AvoidUsingVolatile](https://docs.pmd-code.org/latest/pmd_rules_java_multithreading.html#avoidusingvolatile) - According to the PMD description, the use of volatile is discouraged because it is difficult to use correctly, and requires a good expertise of the Java Memory Model. However, we consulted both the official publication (Freeman 184) and the professor recommended website, refactoring.guru, and found that the use of volatile is a good way to ensure the multi-threading safety of the singleton pattern and follows the "double-checked locking" mechanism. Therefore, we decided to keep the volatile keyword in our singleton pattern implementation.
2. **UseUtilityClass**: [category/java/design/UseUtilityClass](https://docs.pmd-code.org/latest/pmd_rules_java_design.html#useutilityclass) - We understand the PMD rule suggests that utility classes should be final and have a private constructor to prevent instantiation. However, in our case, `ServiceApplication` class is a Springboot special class that is used to start the Springboot application. It is not a utility class. If it is made non-instantiable, the Springboot will reports "IllegalState ApplicationContext failure" error. Therefore, we decided to keep the ServiceApplication class as it is.
3. **UnusedPrivateMethod**: [category/java/bestpractices/UnusedPrivateMethod](https://docs.pmd-code.org/latest/pmd_rules_java_bestpractices.html#unusedprivatemethod) - This is false positive. After checking the code, we confirmed that the methods are used in the project, but PMD does not recognize it. For example, the `errorResponse()` was used in `handleItemNotFoundException()`, `handleForbiddenException()` and etc. The `throwBadRequestException()` was used in `testBadRequestException()`. The `throwForbiddenException()` was used in `testForbiddenException()`, and so on.

### Branch Coverage Report

#### Codecov CI
We use [GitHub Codecov](https://app.codecov.io/) to generate the branch coverage report. 
The Codecov CI is run automatically on every PR to the main branch. The Codecov badge is displayed at the top of this README file.
As a code quality management tool, we also set up the coverage policy to ensure that at each PR,
the overall coverage does not decrease by more than 5%, and the changed code is covered by at least 75%, otherwise the PR will not be approved by Codecov automatically.
![Codecov Graphs](https://codecov.io/github/Alex-XJK/100-of-100-service-team/graphs/icicle.svg?token=10CkTdL5TU)

#### JaCoCo Branch Coverage Report
We use JaCoCo Maven plugin to generate the branch coverage report. To generate the report, first make sure you have run the test suite. Then run the following command:
```bash
mvn jacoco:report
```
The report is located at `./target/site/jacoco/index.html` file.

Currently, the branch coverage is at 86% for the service.
![Branch Coverage](./coverage.png)

### Tool Used
Maven, JUnit, JaCoCo, Maven Checkstyle, AWS RDS, DataGrip

## [Team] Teamwork and Collaboration

### Project Management
We use [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/users/Alex-XJK/projects/2) to manage our tasks and progress.
In the GitHub Projects, we use Kanban board to manage our tasks. We have columns for To Do, In Progress, and Done to keep track of the progress of each task. We also use the GitHub Issues to create tasks and assign them to team members. We use the GitHub Pull Requests to review the code and merge the code into the main branch.

### PR Review Process
We enforce the PR review process to ensure the quality of the code.
All changes in the main branch must be made through a pull request. The pull request must be reviewed by at least one team member and make sure all the discussions are resolved before merging.

### Division of Work
Although the GitHub Projects documents all the tasks done or led by each team member, as per the assignment requirements, we also briefly summarize the general division of work here (please refer to the GitHub Projects for more details):

- **Yifei Luo**: Responsible for the database design, implementation, and its deployment.
- **Phoebe Wang**: Responsible for the API design, service implementation, testing, and external documentation.
- **Jiakai Xu**: Responsible for the initial project setup, overall architecture design and implementation, and the internal documentation.
- **Xintong Yu**: Responsible for the interface integration between service and database.
